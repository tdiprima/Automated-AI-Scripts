This GitHub repo is a **local code-generation tool using Ollama** and a custom model called `code-snippet-generator`.

### What it does

1. **Model Creation (`code_snippet_generator.txt`)**
   This is a [Modelfile](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md) for Ollama. It tells Ollama to:

   * Use `llama3.2` as the base.
   * Act as a **coding assistant** that takes a **task description** and generates a relevant code snippet (e.g., Python, JS, etc.).

2. **Client Code (`code_snippet_generator.js`)**
   This is a Node.js script that:

   * Sends a request to your local Ollama server (`localhost:11434`) with a task description.
   * Streams the response from the model.
   * Parses and prints the code snippet.

### How to run it (step-by-step)

Assuming you're on a Mac/Linux system:

#### 1. **Install Ollama**

If you haven’t already:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### 2. **Start Ollama daemon**

```bash
ollama serve
```

#### 3. **Create the model**

```bash
ollama create code-snippet-generator -f code_snippet_generator.txt
```

#### 4. **Install Node.js dependencies**

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then:

```bash
npm install axios
```

#### 5. **Run the script**

```bash
node code_snippet_generator.js
```

You’ll get a generated code snippet based on the hardcoded prompt in the last line:

```js
generateCodeSnippet("Create a JavaScript function that fetches data from an API and handles errors gracefully.");
```

### TL;DR:

This repo is a minimal custom-code generator using a locally hosted Ollama model. You feed it a task description, it spits out code. Very hackable for building local, privacy-preserving dev tools.

Let me know if you want to turn this into a CLI or a web UI.

Ah, gotcha — that last file you dropped in (`code_snippet_generator.md`) is just **the output** from the repo, not part of the actual codebase. Here's the full picture:

### How it all connects:

1. **`code_snippet_generator.txt`** – Tells Ollama how to behave (like “You’re a coding assistant. Given a task, write code.”).
2. **`code_snippet_generator.js`** – Sends a prompt to the local Ollama server asking it to generate code for a task.
3. **`code_snippet_generator.md`** – This file is a **result**: it's what the model likely generated when asked to "Create a JavaScript function that fetches data from an API and handles errors gracefully." (the hardcoded prompt in the JS).

So in plain English:

* You built a local code generator using Ollama.
* You gave it a task.
* It streamed back a JavaScript snippet.
* You saved that generated output to `code_snippet_generator.md`.

### Why this matters

This MD file **proves the repo works** — it's a successful example of the tool doing its job. If you change the prompt in the `.js` file, you'd get different output, and could save that too.

Let me know if you wanna automate output to `.md` files or give it a GUI or CLI wrapper.
