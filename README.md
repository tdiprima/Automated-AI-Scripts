# Automated Scripts Repo

What can we do that's cool? ðŸ˜Ž

Set up a **custom API integration** between Open WebUI and Ollama. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Automate Common Dev Tasks**: Create scripts to automate routine development tasks like testing, code review, or deployment processes using Ollama models through Open WebUI. For example, run a prompt that checks for code vulnerabilities, offers refactoring suggestions, or generates inline documentation.

2. **Generate Code Snippets with Context**: Use Ollama's LLMs to generate context-specific code snippets directly within Open WebUI based on brief task descriptions. This can speed up repetitive coding, especially if youâ€™re working across JavaScript, Python, and Java.

3. **Enhance Log Parsing and Error Analysis**: Set up a function that takes logs or error outputs from your Red Hat servers and feeds them through a prompt in Ollama to analyze issues or suggest fixes. It could catch patterns and propose solutions, saving you debugging time.

4. **Codebase Search and Knowledge Extraction**: Use a model to analyze codebase segments, identify dependencies, and generate summaries. You could even add a feature to answer questions about your codebase.

5. **Create a ChatOps Bot**: Develop a bot that responds to questions or provides insights into your development environment or current tasks by pulling from relevant models in Ollama. It could respond to queries like "Whatâ€™s the status of [project] deployment?" or "Analyze recent errors in [service]."

Each of these would give you a useful tool and build up your familiarity with both the Open WebUI API and Ollama for practical problem-solving!
