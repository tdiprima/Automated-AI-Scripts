4096 is a solid default for the context window in Llama 3.2, especially for shorter tasks or when hardware limits like VRAM are a factor. It matches the model's base setup and keeps things efficient without overloading your system.

That said, the system prompt in your modelfile is detailed and lengthy—likely over 1,000 tokens on its own. If you plan to process longer inputs (like articles, essays, or multi-paragraph content) while keeping the full guidelines in context, you might run into token limits quickly. This could cut off responses or force truncation.

I recommend increasing it to 8192 if your setup can handle it (most modern GPUs with 8GB+ VRAM should). This gives room for the prompt, user input, and a full output without issues. If you work with very long texts often, go up to 16384, but test first—higher values use more memory and can slow things down on weaker hardware.

To change it, just edit the modelfile: PARAMETER num_ctx 8192 (or your chosen value), then recreate the model with ollama create. Run a quick test with a sample input to confirm it fits your needs.
